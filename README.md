# EMOTION-DETECTION-USING-IMAGE-PROCESSING-TECHNIQUES
We have developed an android based application that enables the user to detect user emotion and have  connected user emotion into an output based system, A unique feature of the developed application is  that it calculates the percentages of different emotions that the user is experiencing, which can either  results in the corresponding emoticon, or a suggestion based output which would suggest a curated playlist  to the user.
